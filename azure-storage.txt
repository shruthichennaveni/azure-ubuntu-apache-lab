Azure storage accounts:

Azure Storage is Microsoft’s cloud storage service.It gives you a safe, scalable place to store:

Files
Images
Videos
Logs
Databases backups
VM disks
Big data
App data



Types of Azure storage:
1.Standard general purpose v2
2.Premium block blobs
3.Premium file shares
4.Premium page blobs


Types of Azure storage service Types:
1. Blob(Binary large object)        use it to store- photos, Videos,document,Backups,Website content,Application data,Logs
    -page Blob --->VM disks
    -Append Blob --->Logs
    -Block Blob--->images, documents, backups
2. Fileshare
3.Queues
4.Table  
5. disk storage

Azure storage redundancy
1.LRS -Locally redundant storage    3 copies in primary region
2. Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)        Copies across zones (AZ1, AZ2, AZ3)
3.Geo-redundant storage (GRS)           Data copied to another region (secondary region)
4.RA-GRS Read Access Geo-redundant storage (GRS)
5.Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS)     ZRS in primary + GRS backup.
6.RA-GZRS- Geo-zone-redundant storage 

Performance
1.Standard
2.Premium

Access Tiers:

Hot tier - An online tier optimized for storing data that is accessed or modified frequently. 
        The hot tier has the highest storage costs, but the lowest access costs.
Cool tier - An online tier optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed or modified. 
        Data in the cool tier should be stored for a minimum of 30 days. The cool tier has lower storage costs and higher access costs compared to the hot tier.
Cold tier - An online tier optimized for storing data that is rarely accessed or modified, 
        but still requires fast retrieval. Data in the cold tier should be stored for a minimum of 90 days. The cold tier has lower storage costs and higher access costs compared to the cool tier.
Archive tier - An offline tier optimized for storing data that is rarely accessed, 
        and that has flexible latency requirements, on the order of hours. Data in the archive tier should be stored for a minimum of 180 days.
Smart tier - Smart tier automatically moves your data between the hot, cool, 
        and cold access tiers based on usage patterns, optimizing your costs for these access tiers automatically

 Pricing Basics
 ============
Azure Storage pricing depends on:
Storage type (Blob/File/Table/Queue)
Redundancy (LRS/ZRS/GRS)
Access tier (Hot/Cool/Archive)
Operations (read/write)
Data egress (transfer out)
